# Kraken Analysis

## Reference Database Download
Here we require a reference database and you can find the reference database in this given [link](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2).

Choose the database based on your computational capacity and right click on that database folder and copy the link

![Database](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d227ebb-c37b-4025-96aa-dd613d429ef4)

And give this below command with the link copied to download the database folder
```bash
wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/k2_standard_08gb_20240904.tar.gz
```
Extract the compressed folder content to desired folder. And you are done with the database.

Keep the trimmed files and database in one folder for convenience.
